# Intended outcomes 
After attending this workshop, we hope users come away with these skills:

* How to successfully log in
* How to submit a job
* What to do if something doesn't work
* How to work responsibly on a shared computing resource

# Hydra (SI/HPC)
![](images/hydra-overview.jpg)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### People

* Rebecca Dikow (OCIO Data Science Lab), Vanessa Gonz√°lez (NMNH GGI), Matt Kweskin (NMNH LAB), and Mike Trizna (OCIO Data Science Lab) provide support for non-CfA users.

* DJ Ding (OCIO) is the full-time Hydra system administrator.
 
* Sylvain Korzennik (SAO) is the HPC Analyst and provides support for CfA users (and is responsible for the cluster configuration).
 </script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Getting help 
* The [Wiki](https://confluence.si.edu/display/HPC/High+Performance+Computing) contains detailed documentation
* Email `si-hpc-admin@si.edu` for system-level issues
* For non-CfA users: 
	* 	Bioinformatics Brown Bag (Thursdays, 1-2pm ET, on Zoom) 
	* Email `si-hpc@si.edu` (monitored by Rebecca, Vanessa, Matt, and Mike) 
* CfA users:
	* email [Sylvain](mailto:hpc@cfa.harvard.edu) or sign up for his [office hours](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/cf/services/cluster/request-office-hours.html).

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Being a good Hydra citizen
* We strive to provide support for users that is inclusive, welcoming, and helps you get your science done. 

* We request that users be respectful when asking for help. While we attempt to answer questions rapidly, user support is no one's full-time duties.

* Hydra users agree to abide by its [usage policies](https://confluence.si.edu/display/HPC/Hydra+Policies).

### How is a cluster different than a single-user system?

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### How is a cluster different than a single-user system?
* Hydra has 90 compute nodes with between 20 and 128 CPUs each, for a total of 4,896 CPUs.

* Compute nodes have a range of 128GB to 2TB RAM each.

* Two compute nodes have 2 GPUs each.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">

### Important Takeaways

* Users never need to connect to the Head Node.

* Log in to either `hydra-login01` or `hydra-login02`.

* Do not run commands that use substantial CPU on the login nodes, that's what the compute nodes are for.

* "*Misuse*" of any resources affect the other users (shared resource).

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Disk Storage 

* When you log in, you go to your `/home` directory.

* `/home` is for your own installed programs and scripts, not for data storage.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Disk Storage 

* Data (large files) belong on `/pool` or `/scratch` and users should run their jobs from here.

* `/pool` and `/scratch` are scrubbed - files older than 180 days are removed.

* `/data` offers some unscrubbed storage for small files (final results, configuration files, etc.)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Connecting to Hydra

* telework.si.edu (web terminal)
* Mac direct connect (onsite or VPN)
* Windows direct connect (onsite, remote desktop, VPN)
* CfA (VPN, `login.cfa.harvard.edu`, and *trusted* computers: CF/HEA-managed desktops)
* If you don't have an SI VPN but would like to, there is a request form in the SI [ServiceDesk](https://servicedesk.si.edu)
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The job scheduler - UGE

* We use UGE (Univa Grid Engine) to schedule resources on Hydra.

* When you submit a job, UGE adds it to the queue and sends it to a compute
  node with the resources you requested when they become available.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### The job scheduler - UGE

* Each job is assigned a JOB ID, which you can use to check on progress and
  look at how it used resources when it is complete.

* UGE limits how many resources each user can use concurrently.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Submitting jobs

* The most common way to run analysis on Hydra is by submitting a job file using the command `qsub`

* We will show you how to build a job file in just a bit

* Users can also start an interactive session using `qrsh`
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Queues
Hydra has different queues to accommodate different resource requests:
* High CPU queues: `sThC.q`, `mThC.q`, `lThC.q`, `uThC.q`
* High Memory queues: `sThM.q`, `mThM.q`, `lThM.q`, `uThM.q`

There are other more specialized queues, check the wiki for more information.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Parallelization
* Depending on the software, you may be able to run a job in **parallel**, which can speed up your analysis.
* Some software uses **threaded** parallelization, where the job is divided across CPUs on a single compute node
* Some software can be compiled to use **MPI** parallelization, where the job is divided across multiple compute nodes
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Parallelization

Look at software documentation to check which kind of parallelization, if any, your software uses and at the [Wiki](https://confluence.si.edu/display/HPC/High+Performance+Computing) for how to request the needed resources. 
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Parallelization hints
* Some (bioinformatics) software will grab all the CPUs on a compute node unless you tell it otherwise (*not appropriate on a shared machine*).
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Parallelization hints

* Best practice is to use `$NSLOTS` in place of a number of threads in your command. We will demo this in a bit.
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Warnings

* Users that are:
    * Running a job that is inefficient (using <30% of the requested CPU resources), or
    * Running a high-memory job that is using much less than the requested amount of RAM,

will receive an automated warning email. 

*We request that you monitor these jobs closely and contact us if you receive repeated warnings*
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Warnings

* When the cluster usage is high, some ineeficient jobs will get killed (*fair use* policy).

* Important to receive and read these automatic emails from Hydra (see usage
  policy).
