# Introduction to Hydra

# Code of conduct
We are operating under the Carpentries [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

If you feel that someone has violated this Code of Conduct, please email `si-hpc@si.edu`.

# Introductions

---

# Intended outcomes
After attending this workshop, we hope users come away with these skills:

* How to successfully log in
* How to submit a job
* What to do if something doesn't work
* How to work responsibly on a shared computing resource

# Hydra (SI/HPC)

---

### People

* Rebecca Dikow (OCIO Data Science Lab), Vanessa Gonz√°lez (NMNH GGI), Matt Kweskin (NMNH LAB), and Mike Trizna (OCIO Data Science Lab) provide support for non-CfA users.

* DJ Ding (OCIO) is the full-time Hydra system administrator.
* Sylvain Korzennik (SAO) is the HPC Analyst and provides support for CfA users.

---

### Getting help
* The [Wiki](https://confluence.si.edu/display/HPC/High+Performance+Computing) contains detailed documentation
* Email `si-hpc-admin@si.edu` for system-level issues
* For non-CfA users:
	* 	Bioinformatics Brown Bag (Wednesdays, 12-1pm ET, on Zoom)
	* Email `si-hpc@si.edu` (monitored by Rebecca, Vanessa, Matt, and Mike)
* CfA users:
	* email Sylvain or sign up for his office hours


---

### Being a good Hydra citizen
* We strive to provide support for users that is inclusive, welcoming, and helps you get your science done.

* We request that users be respectful when asking for help. While we attempt to answer questions rapidly, user support is no one's full-time duties.

### How is a cluster different than a single-user system?

---

### How is a cluster different than a single-user system?
* Hydra has 90 compute nodes with between 20 and 128 CPUs each, for a total of 4,896 CPUs

* Compute nodes have a range of 128GB to 2TB RAM each


---


### Important Takeaways

* Users never need to connect to the Head Node

* Log in to either `hydra-login01` or `hydra-login02`

* Do not run commands that use substantial CPU on the login nodes, that's what the compute nodes are for


---

### Disk Storage

* When you log in, you go to your `/home` directory

* `/home` is for your own installed programs and scripts, not for data storage

* Data belong on `/pool` or `/scratch` and users should run their jobs from here

* `/pool` and `/scratch` are scrubbed - files older than 180 days are removed

---

### Connecting to Hydra

* telework.si.edu (web terminal)
* Mac direct connect (onsite or VPN)
* Windows direct connect (onsite, remote desktop, VPN)
* CfA (telework.si.edu, login.cfa.harvard.edu, SAO VPN)

* If you don't have an SI VPN but would like to, there is a request form in the SI ServiceDesk

---

### The job scheduler - UGE

* We use UGE (Univa Grid Engine) to schedule resources on Hydra

* When you submit a job, UGE adds it to the queue and sends it to a compute node with the resources you request

* Each job is assigned a JOB ID, which you can use to check on progress and look at how it used resources when it is complete

---

### Submitting jobs

* The most common way to run analysis on Hydra is by submitting a job file using the command `qsub`

* We will show you how to build a job file in just a bit

* Users can also start an interactive session using `qrsh`

---

### Queues
Hydra has different queues to accommodate different resource requests:
* High CPU queues: `sThC.q`, `mThC.q`, `lThC.q`, `uThC.q`
* High Memory queues: `sThM.q`, `mThM.q`, `lThM.q`, `uThM.q`

There are other more specialized queues, check the wiki for more information

---

### Parallelization
* Depending on the software, you may be able to run a job in **parallel**, which can speed up your analysis.
* Some software uses **threaded** parallelization, where the job is divided across CPUs on a single compute node
* Some software can be compiled to use **MPI** parallelization, where the job is divided across multiple compute nodes


Look at software documentation to check which kind of parallelization, if any, your software uses

---

### Parallelization hints
* Some (bioinformatics) software will grab all the CPUs on a compute node unless you tell it otherwise

* Best practice is to use `$NSLOTS` in place of a number of threads in your command. We will demo this in a bit

---

### Warnings

* Users that are:
    * Running a job that is inefficient (using <30% of the requested CPU resources), or
    * Running a high-memory job that is using much less than the requested amount of RAM,

*will receive an automated warning email. We request that you monitor these jobs closely and contact us if you receive repeated warnings*
